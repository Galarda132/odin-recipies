    <img src="../Images/Gnocchi.jpg">
    <p>An easy Italian Pasta Dish recipe, <strong>Homemade Potato Gnocchi</strong>, made with only 4 ingredients. Tossed in a simple tomato sauce.</p>
    <p>These soft, delicate <em>Gnocchi</em> will make a delicious Dinner idea.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg Desiree potatoes, unpeeled</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>115g (3/4 cup) plain flour</li>
        <li>Plain flour, extra, to dust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a saucepan of cold water. Cover. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce to low. Cook for 30 minutes or until soft when pierced with a skewer.</li>
        <li>Let the potatoes cool for about 30 minutes, then peel with a small knife. If they're still too hot to handle, wear clean rubber gloves. Return potatoes to the pan.</li>
        <li>Mash potato until just smooth, then press one-quarter of potato through a sieve into a bowl. Repeat in 3 more batches. Add salt (1 tsp salt) and season with pepper.</li>
        <li>Add flour (115g (3/4 cup) plain flour). Mix to form a firm, slightly sticky dough. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour (Plain flour, extra, to dust), but only a tablespoon at a time. Too much makes the dough heavy.</li>
        <li>Dust a tray, lined with a clean, dry tea towel, with flour. Cut dough into 4 even portions. Roll each portion on a lightly floured surface to a 2cm-thick log.</li>
        <li>Use a lightly floured knife to cut logs into 2cm pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place on the lined tray, making sure the gnocchi don't touch each other.</li>
        <li>Gently roll, 1 at a time, over the back of a lightly floured fork. The ridges help sauce cling to the gnocchi and give them a traditional Italian finish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large shallow saucepan of water to the boil. Add one-quarter of the gnocchi. When they rise to the surface - after about 2-3 minutes - they're ready.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a baking tray, making sure there's a little cooking water still on the tray. This stops them sticking together.</li>
    </ol>
